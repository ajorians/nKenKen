KenKen for the TI-NSpire Graphing Calculator

About:
This is a puzzle game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire (CX) with ndless 3.1 and higher.

It is played where you fill in all the cells with values between 1 and the dimension of the board.  Each row and each column contains all of the numbers once and only once.  Furthermore a group of cells have a value and a mathematical operator.  Using all the cell's value with that mathematical operator it must be possible to reach that value.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nKenKen-sdl.prg.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 or higher on your calculator in order to run it!

Also included is an external level.  You can add that to your calculator as well.  Once you start the main game it will register the .ken extension; then you can run the level to play it.

How to play:
You put a number in a cell by moving the selector over the cell.  You move the selector with the arrow keys.  Then to put in a value press the number on the number pad that you would like.  To clear out the value press the 0 key on the number pad.

Keep playing until you beat the level.  Press Escape to return to the main menu and again to exit the program.
